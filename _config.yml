  Hi, I'm Martin. I'm a Master's student in computer science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca).
  Before studying in Waterloo, I was an undergraduate and graduate computer science student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) in Germany.
  
  My research is at the intersection of machine learning and hydrology. We focus on developing data-driven techniques for streamflow prediction, both neural and non-neural models.
  We work in collaboration with hydrologists as part of the Canadian [Global Water Futures](https://gwf.usask.ca/) program.
  My supervisor is [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/).
