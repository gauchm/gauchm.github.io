    In parallel to my studies in Karlsruhe, I worked part-time as a working student in the cloud HR software development at SAP SuccessFactors.
    As part of the Rules Engine scrum team, I worked on designing and developing a rules framework that enables users to customize automatic business processes in their HR system.
    My work involved Java programming as well as data analytics tasks, using Python, Jupyter notebooks, SQL, and Splunk.

    Between high school and university, I did a full-time internship in software development.
    I designed, developed, and tested on-premise HR software for the SAP ERP solution.
    My work mostly involved programming in ABAP. Also, I learned about SAP's ERP software and its customizing.
