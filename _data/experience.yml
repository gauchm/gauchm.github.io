    I develop neural and non-neural machine learning algorithms to predict streamflow from spatially and temporally distributed input data. A large part of this work is in collaboration with environmental scientists.
    Besides, we work with domain specialists from the environmental sciences on developing the [Cuizinart](https://tuna.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cuizinart), a cloud-based interactive platform that allows researchers to "slice and dice" large environmental datasets.

    Besides my main research focus on machine learning during my graduate studies, I worked as a graduate research assistant. In collaboration with domain specialists from the environmental sciences, we developed the cloud-based [Cuizinart](https://tuna.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cuizinart) platform that provides access to large environmental datasets. 
    Also, we worked on solutions for metadata management in the [Global Water Futures](https://gwf.usask.ca/) program.

    Between high school and university, I did a full-time internship in software development.
    I designed, developed, and tested on-premise HR software for the SAP ERP solution.
    My work mostly involved programming in ABAP. Also, I learned about SAP's ERP software and its customizing.
