    Besides doing research, I work as a research assistant during my graduate studies. Together with domain specialists from the environmental sciences, we're developing the [Cuizinart](https://tuna.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cuizinart), a cloud-based interactive platform that allows reasearchers to "slice and dice" large environmental datasets.
    Also, we work on solutions for metadata management in the [Global Water Futures](https://gwf.usask.ca/) program.

    In parallel to my studies in Karlsruhe, I worked part-time as a working student in the cloud HR software development at SAP SuccessFactors.
    As part of the Rules Engine scrum team, I worked on designing and developing a rules framework that enables users to customize automatic business processes in their HR system.
    My work involved Java programming as well as data analytics tasks, using Python, Jupyter notebooks, SQL, and Splunk.

    My work mostly involved programming in ABAP. Also, I learned about SAP's ERP software and its customizing.
