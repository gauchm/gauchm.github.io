    Supervised by Jimmy Lin, my research is on machine learning in hydrology. \\
    I develop neural and non-neural machine learning algorithms to predict streamflow from spatially and temporally distributed input data.
    A large part of this work is in collaboration with environmental scientists.

    After two exchange terms at the University of Waterloo, I decided to continue pursuing my Master's there. Switching to Waterloo allowed me to do a lot more research throughout my degree, as opposed to just taking courses and writing a thesis at the end.

    Bachelor's thesis: **Data-Driven Approaches to Predict Material Failure and Analyze Material Models** \\
    In my thesis, I developed data-driven models to predict failure events of an observed material and compared traditional machine learning approaches with recurrent neural network architectures.
